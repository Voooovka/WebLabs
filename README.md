# Getting Started with Create React App

The task was: Home page

Description: Start creating your React App with a simple Home page (see the link to wireframe above). Your e-commerce app subject is about your entities from previous (3-5) works.

Variants -  (products that you are ‘selling’) the same as for previous works. (see the description to 3rd work)

Requirements: 
●	You have to use only React.js library for all of your mark-up. Which means - your index.html file shouldn’t be touched.
●	Use create-react-app tool for creating base of your project

●	Your Home page should follow the wireframe, i.e all of the elements ( header, navigation, footer etc. ) from wireframes must be presented on your website.
●	Design: You have to use CSS styling or/and component libraries. Don't overthink it, use your imagination for UI, BUT the work with almost no styling is unacceptable.
●	Functionality: For this work nothing but view only part is required. Any interaction (links/buttons) is not necessary, but you will have to complete them in your next labs.
●	Code style: 
○	Project structure: Your UI elements should be logically separated into React components (one file for each component) - at least 5 component files are required. In other words, you can’t just put all your JSX into 1-2 files. 
○	Use Functional components instead of Class components

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
